# Headless CMS Wordpress Backend/NextJS, Typescript, Tailwind Frontend

## Description

Originally a sort of commission piece for my friend Sepy Baghaei, a successful theatre director based in London, it became a massive learning project for myself,
and a vehicle to host a new website for Sepy, as she had had the same standard Wordpress site for around 10 years(!).

I had some prior experience with Typescript, NextJS/React from making my own portfolio website, but this project had the looming issue of "how do I make something that my user can interact with, WITHOUT me." As Sepy had been using Wordpress to edit the site that she already had, I was thankfully guided by my mentor into using that as a backend for the frontend that I would create. This also meant that I would have to learn how Sepy interacted with the site, how she populated it with data, and how I could get her to use it so it became an almost seamless transition.

I learnt a lot about component libraries, about using motion, fonts, and queries especially through graphql, to query the WPress CMS in order to populate my frontend with her content, possibly the most difficult part.

It has been a fantastic learning experience, and has also given me the chance to work with someone who isn't an engineer or in tech. Real world experience that influenced the way that I work.

## Technologies used

- Typescript
- NextJS 15 / React
- Wordpress CMS
- Tailwind

## Design

In the first meeting with Sepy, we went through her original website and I ascertained what it is she liked about it and what she would like changed.

The original website was basic, using wordpress, having minimal design and using basic page structure.

Sepy quite liked this, and so we kept to that mostly. As mentioned previously, I had prior experience with NextJS, so elected to use this and tailwind for styling. Sepy wanted a dark colour scheme, and mostly wanted to have a better improved gallery, which eventually led to the carousel on the landing page:

The site consists of five pages:
